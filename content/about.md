# Mission

This collective is an effort to experiment, to learn, to read, to discuss and to debate ideas that help build new imaginations of what advancing the field of AI can be; by exploring decolonial and other theories. Over time you'll find posts from many different writers and with many different viewpoints, and in many different styles. But always working experimentally towards learning and figuring things out. 

This is a community initiative, with the aim to convene a collective conversation, and to develop practical actions that can shape the trajectory of our field towards well-being rather than harm.  It involves many groups, including Black in AI, the Deep Learning Indaba, Data Science Africa, and others. If you want to get involved, please get in touch at info@decolonialai.com.
