# Mission

Our collective is an effort to experiment, to learn, to read, to discuss and to debate ideas that help build new imaginations of what advancing the field of AI can be; by exploring decolonial and many other theories and histories. Over time you'll find posts from many writers and with varying viewpoints, and in many styles. But always working experimentally, and learning and unlearning concepts and ideas to simply help build deeper knowledge and figure things out. 

This is a community initiative that hopes to create a collective conversation: to develop practical actions that can shape the trajectory of our field towards well-being rather than harm,  that is intentional in action and centers the impacts on the vulnerable rather than the powerful. It involves many groups, including Black in AI, the Deep Learning Indaba, Data Science Africa, and many others. We welcome wider involvement, so please get in touch at decolonialai - at- googlegroups.com.
